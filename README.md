Description: A dashboard to provide information to airport stakeholders, retailers, and consumers about the Philippine aviation industry.

Setup instructions (for local running):
Recommended: Using the Pycharm IDE, create a project and install the pandas, plotly, and dash packages. Then, replace all contents of the project folder with the contents of the finalProject folder in this repository. Next, run the main.py file. Lastly, click/access the link that appears in the console. This will take you to the complete dashboard page.
Possible Alternatives (non-specific and untested): Download the finalProject folder and run using some other IDE, such as perhaps IDLE, with the above mentioned packages installed in the local devce's version of Python. May also be possible via terminal/command line.
