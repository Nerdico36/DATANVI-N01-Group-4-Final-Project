# DATANVI-N01-Group-4-Final-Project
The codes for the final project submission of group 4 (Abot, Co, Dalangin, Guidote) in DATANVI N01 for Term 1 AY 24-25

Name: Visualization of the Performance of Philippine Airports

Link to App: N/A (see setup instructions)

Description: A dashboard to provide information to airport stakeholders, retailers, and consumers about the Philippine aviation industry. Includes a map with airport locations (by size), a graph of the top 5 PH airports by flights, a time-interval-adjustable histogram based on airport selected from the map, and a second time histogram filterable by flight type also based on selected airport.

Project Team:

Nikolas Benjamin G. Abot

Matthew Benedict M. Co

Patricia Anh S. Dalangin

Antonio Luis P. Guidote

Setup instructions (for local running):

Recommended:
1. Using the Pycharm IDE, create a project and install the pandas, plotly, and dash packages.
2. Then, download the main.py file from the finalProjectFiles folder of this repository and use it to replace the auto-generated main.py file in the Pycharm project folder.
3. Next, download the whole datsets folder from this repository into the Pycharm project folder.
4. Then, unzip the PH_Airports_Arrivals_and_Departures.zip file and move the resulting PH_Airports_Arrivals_and_Departures.csv file into the datasets folder.
5. Next, run the main.py file.
6. Lastly, click/access the link that appears in the console. This will take you to the complete dashboard page.

Possible Alternatives (non-specific and untested): Perform steps 2-4 above in a different file directory and run main.py using some other IDE, such as perhaps IDLE, with the above mentioned packages installed in the local devce's version of Python. May also be possible via terminal/command line.
